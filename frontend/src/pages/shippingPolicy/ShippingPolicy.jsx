        <b>DAMAGED AND LOST PACKAGES</b> <br /> <br />

        Customers are responsible for inspecting all packages for any visible signs of damage or missing items before accepting delivery. Customers should compare the items received with the packaging slips or invoices enclosed in the package. If any damage or missing items are noticed, customers should immediately notify Umbrella Custom Packaging and the delivery courier. Failure to file a claim within <b>3 business days</b> of order delivery may result in Umbrella Custom Packaging not being responsible for any damage or missing items. Additionally, 3rd party shipping errors, omissions, or damaged shipments are not the responsibility of Umbrella Custom Packaging. <br /> <br />

        Extra complimentary pieces are usually shipped with each ordered product without additional charges. Occasionally, the shipment may contain slightly fewer pieces than the ordered quantity. <br /> <br />

        Packages that need to be reshipped because of the incorrect shipping address provided by the customer will incur additional shipping and handling charges. <br /> <br />
