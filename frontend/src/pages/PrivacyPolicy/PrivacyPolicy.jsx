Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to not receive these types of communications. If you do not wish to receive future emails, send an email to suggestions@umbrellapackaging.com.<br />

        <h2 style={{fontSize: '32px', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Newsletter</h2><br />

        Customers are automatically subscribed to our newsletter. We ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our user’s privacy, we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. If you do not wish to receive future newsletters, send an email to info@umbrellapackaging.com.<br />

        <h2 style={{fontSize: '32px', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Customer Service</h2><br />

        We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services. Our production and customer service use both email and phone information to communicate with customers in regards to issues relating to the in-process order.<br />

        <h2 style={{fontSize: '32px', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Legal Disclaimer</h2><br />

        Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, or legal process served on our website.<br />

        <h2 style={{fontSize: '32px', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Third-Party Intermediaries</h2><br />

        We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br />

        <h2 style={{fontSize: '32px', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Business Transitions</h2><br />

        If Umbrella Custom Packaging goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. If as a result of the business transition, the users’ personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.<br />

        <h2 style={{fontSize: '32px', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Choice/Opt-out</h2><br />

        Our users are allowed to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an ‘opt-out’ mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don’t want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.<br />

        Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line of the email or emailing us at suggestions@umbrellapackaging.com.<br />

        <h2 style={{fontSize: '32px', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Links</h2><br />

        Our sites may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.<br />

        <h2 style={{fontSize: '32px', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Security</h2><br />

        Our Websites take every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and offline.<br />

        When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry—SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing.’<br />

        While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Employees must enter their password to gain access to user information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a high-security environment at our co-location facility.<br />

        <h2 style={{fontSize: '32px', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Supplementation of Information</h2><br />

        <h2 style={{fontSize: '32px', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Notification of Changes</h2><br />

        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information by the privacy policy under which the information was collected.<br />

        If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.<br />

        If customers have opted out of all communication with the site or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying users of the change.<br />
